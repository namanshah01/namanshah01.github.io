ConvNet trained on over 5000 Chest XRay images to classify presence of Pneumonia in a patient. Achieved 0.83 recall, 0.91 precision and 0.87 f1-score. Handled high overfitting, through data augmentation, batchnorm and dropouts reducing variance. Created a pipeline to serve the model on a web application through flask, deployed on Heroku.
